## Separation of Particles from a Gas

This video shows what happens inside an operating reverse flow gas cyclone separator. Inlet gas is brought tangentially into the cylindrical section and a strong vortex is thus created inside the cyclone body. Particles in the gas are subjected to centrifugal forces which move them radially outwards, against the inward flow of gas and towards the inside surface of the cyclone on which the solids separate. The direction of flow of the vortex reverses near the bottom of the cyclone and the gas leaves via the outlet in the vertical pipe at the top, which is called the vortex finder. The solids at the wall of the cyclone are pushed downwards by the outer vortex and out of the solids exit, which is sealed to gas flow.
